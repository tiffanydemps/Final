<p> I have always loved the work in the field of Communication. Growing up my mother worked in Advertising, I often attended really fun events with her and we always had great tickets to The Sol Basketball Games. The Sol was part of the WNBA and served as the official Women's Basketball Team for Miami. I loved how much she enjoyed her job! It was very cool getting early exposure to the industry and I realized how much of a need there was a need for constant thinkers, like myself. I am entering the field with a different specialty called Interactive Media. There is a wide range of things you can do with this specialty, we design, code, develop and create. My areas of interest include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Technology in Entertainment </li>
    <li> Artificial Intelligence </li>
    <li> Content Design </li>
  </ul>
